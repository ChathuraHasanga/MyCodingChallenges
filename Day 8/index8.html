            <p>Springerdata offers a variety of billing options, including monthly 
                and annual subscription plans, as well as pay-as-you-go pricing for
                 certain services. Payment is typically made through a credit card

            <h3>Can I get a refund for my subscription?<span class="arrows"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></span></h3>
            <p>We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for most of its subscription plans.

                  you can request a full refund. Refunds for subscriptions that have been 
                  active for longer than 30 days may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
